# Singleton Design Pattern in JavaScript

## What is the Singleton Pattern?

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Key Features

1. **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class can exist
2. **Global Access**: The instance is accessible from anywhere in your application
3. **Lazy Initialization**: The instance is created only when needed

## When to Use the Singleton Pattern

- Managing shared resources (database connections, file systems)
- Coordinating actions across the system (logging, caching)
- When exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions

## Benefits

- **Memory Efficient**: Prevents creating multiple instances that could waste resources
- **Shared State**: Provides a consistent state across the application
- **Controlled Access**: Restricts instantiation to a single point

## Implementation in JavaScript

There are several ways to implement the Singleton pattern in JavaScript:

### 1. Using a Module Pattern

```javascript
const Singleton = (function() {
  let instance;
  
  function createInstance() {
    // Private members
    const privateVariable = "I'm private";
    
    return {
      // Public members
      publicMethod: function() {
        return "I'm a method from the singleton instance";
      },
      getPrivateVariable: function() {
        return privateVariable;
      }
    };
  }
  
  return {
    getInstance: function() {
      if (!instance) {
        instance = createInstance();
      }
      return instance;
    }
  };
})();
```

### 2. Using ES6 Class

```javascript
class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    if (Singleton.instance) {
      return Singleton.instance;
    }
    
    this.data = [];
    Singleton.instance = this;
  }
  
  addItem(item) {
    this.data.push(item);
  }
  
  getItems() {
    return this.data;
  }
}
```

### 3. Using a Simple Object

```javascript
const Singleton = {
  property: "value",
  method() {
    return "Hello, I'm a singleton object!";
  }
};

Object.freeze(Singleton); // Prevents modification
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Testing**: Singletons can complicate unit testing
- **Hidden Dependencies**: They create implicit dependencies in your code
- **Thread Safety**: In environments with concurrency, additional steps may be needed
- **Tight Coupling**: Can lead to tightly coupled code that's harder to maintain

## When Not to Use

- When you need multiple instances with different configurations
- When testing in isolation is a priority
- When you need to separate concerns clearly

## Alternatives

- Dependency Injection
- Factory Pattern
- Simple module exports
